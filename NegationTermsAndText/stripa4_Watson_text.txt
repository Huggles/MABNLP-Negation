 (3 mmHg) Admission summary This 85 year old woman with prior inferior myocardial infarction for which she underwent primary percutaneous coronary intervention and also suffering from impaired renal function, type 2 diabetes mellitus, chronic atrial fibrillation and left ventricular ejection fraction of 40-45%, moderate mitral valve regurgitation and mild pulmonary hypertension, was admitted with left sided heart failure caused by NSTEMI and respiratory infection.
 Therapy was started with furosemide intravenously after which symptoms resided.
 There was a deterioration of renal function which recovered till prior values (eGFR 27ml/min).
 The echocardiography showed reasonable left en diminised right ventricular function.
 Patient was put on furosemide 40 mg BD, rate control was optimised by increasing metoprolol.
  Patient fell at home and showed some hematomas at presentation, therefore a brain CT was performed which showed no haemorrhages, but did show a fracture of the left orbit base which was treated conservatively.
 Patient was discharged in pretty good shape without extra home care and will be followed up in the outpatient clinic.
  Conclusion: 1.
	Both left and right sided heart failure, cased by 2 and 3 2.
	Non-ST elevation myocardial infarction 3.
	Respiratory infection 4.
	Fall resulting in fracture of left orbit base  Policy after discharge Heart failure outpatient clinic within 2 weeks Cardiology outpatient clinic within 4-6 weeks Discharge medication Acenocoumarol 1 mg OD varying dose Clopidogreal 75 mg OD Furosemide tablet 40 mg BD Lisinopril 20 mg OD Metformin 500 mg OD Metoprolol succinate 100 mg BD, 1 table 8am, 0.
